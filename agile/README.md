# Agile - Fundamentals

# Why Choose Agile?

**The Challenge:**  
How can you deliver valuable products when customer needs are often unclear or evolve over time?

**The Approach:**  
*Agile enables flexibility, allowing teams to focus on delivering continuous value through adaptability.*

# The Agile Manifesto

Key Agile values:
- **Individuals and interactions** over rigid processes and tools
- **Delivering working products** over excessive documentation
- **Collaboration with customers** over strict contract terms
- **Embracing change** over sticking to the initial plan

*While the items on the left are prioritised, the items on the right still hold value.*

# Understanding Agile

- A collaborative approach focused on delivering value through iterative progress.
- Guided by 4 core values and 12 principles.

### **Core Concepts:**
- Diverse teams collaborate to produce high-quality, valuable products.
- Success is measured by value delivered, not by following a set plan.
- Agile thrives on flexibility and the ability to adapt to changes.

# Implementing Agile

1. Begin with an MVP (**Minimum Viable Product**) containing essential features.
2. Continuously improve based on feedback, refining through short cycles (sprints).
3. Agile tools like Scrum, Kanban, and DevOps pipelines optimise team efficiency and output.

## Introduction

Agile is a modern software delivery philosophy, created to address the limitations of traditional, process-heavy development (**Waterfall**). 

It is a set of guiding principles with various methodologies for implementation, such as TDD, Scrum, Lean, and Kanban. 

Adopting Agile requires a shift in mindset, culture, and team structures, which can vary across organisations. The deeper the adoption, the greater the benefitsâ€”such as improved flexibility, reduced blockers, and a higher likelihood of meeting customer needs.

## Scrum

One of the most widely used Agile frameworks, Scrum promotes cross-functional teams (Scrum Team) working in short sprints with regular standups. Sprint planning guides the team to pull tasks from the broader backlog into the sprint backlog. After each sprint, retrospectives are held to reflect on progress, with incomplete tasks pushed back into the general backlog.

## Agile and DevOps

Agile and DevOps work hand in hand. Agile focuses on short release cycles, MVPs, and adapting to shifting requirements. DevOps emphasises continuous integration, early code merging, and rapid feature deployment to users. 

As an organisation advances in Agile, the need for DevOps practices typically grows.
